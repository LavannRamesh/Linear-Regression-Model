Uncertainty-Aware Facial Age Prediction
🎯 Business Problem Solved
Traditional facial age prediction models provide single-point estimates without indicating prediction reliability. This creates significant risks in business applications:

  Child Protection Systems: Overconfident wrong predictions could allow inappropriate content access

  Healthcare Diagnostics: Incorrect age assessments might lead to misdiagnosis

  Marketing Personalization: Wrong age targeting wastes advertising budgets

  Security Systems: False age verification compromises access control

Our solution addresses these risks by providing confidence intervals alongside predictions, enabling businesses to make risk-aware decisions.
